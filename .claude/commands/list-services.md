# List All Services

List all Kubernetes services deployed in this infrastructure.

```bash
ls -1 /System/Volumes/Data/mnt/code/infra/modules/kubernetes/
```

Provide a summary of the services, grouped by category if possible (media, monitoring, productivity, etc.).

Note: This command runs locally since it only reads the filesystem.
